## FAQ

- **Why _did_ I start this repo?**

  - I was bored and wanted to learn React Native.

- **Did you learn _anything_ from the adventure?**
  - I think React Native has a ways to go, but it
  - is a really fast way to get both iOS and Android
  - functionality for simple things right out of the
  - box.
